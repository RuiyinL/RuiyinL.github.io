About Me
======

Awarded a dual Ph.D. in the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the **University of Groningen** (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Groningen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RUG</a>, Groningen, the Netherlands) and the School of Computer Science at the **Wuhan University** (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_University" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WHU</a>, Wuhan, China). My research focused on Software Engineering (SE) related issues, which led to peer-reviewed publications in leading SE conferences (e.g., ICPC, ICSA, EASE, APSEC) and journals (e.g., JSEP, IST). My current interests focus on utilizing data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to tackle SE tasks (e.g., mining software repositories and conducting empirical software engineering studies to uncover valuable insights and actionable information).

I have a solid foundation in computer science and I am enthusiastic about exploring the application of cutting-edge AI techniques to address the challenges faced in the SE domain. I firmly believe that by leveraging the power of AI, we can develop innovative solutions and enhance the effectiveness of SE practices. I look forward to collaborating with fellow researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts alike, as we delve into the exciting realm of computer science.
