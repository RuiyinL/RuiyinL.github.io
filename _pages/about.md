I am a joint doctorate Ph.D. candidate in the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the University of Groningen ([RUG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Groningen), Groningen, the Netherlands) and School of Computer Science at the Wuhan University ([WHU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan_University), Wuhan, China). I'm currently working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. [Paris Avgeriou](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/) and Prof. Dr. [Peng Liang](https://www.cs.rug.nl/search/People/PengLiang). 

I published peer-reviewed conference papers in leading Software Engineering (SE) venues (e.g., ICPC, ICSA, EASE, APSEC) and journals (e.g., JSEP, IST). My current research focus on utilizing data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to tackle SE tasks (e.g., mining software repositories and conducting empirical software engineering studies to uncover valuable insights and actionable information).

I have a solid foundation in computer science and I am enthusiastic about exploring the application of cutting-edge AI techniques to address the challenges faced in the SE domain. I firmly believe that by leveraging the power of AI, we can develop innovative solutions and enhance the effectiveness of SE practices. I look forward to collaborating with fellow researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts alike, as we delve into the exciting realm of computer science.
